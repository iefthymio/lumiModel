Using some simple machine learning techniques (outlier detection, clustering and linear regression) to predict emittance, intensity and luminosity based on Run 2 data.

**The ML model was run for all Fills of 2017 and some 2018 and the saved pkl are in eos, together with the scripts-tests, check /eos/project/l/lhc-lumimod/LuminosityFollowUp/MachineLearning_Model**
